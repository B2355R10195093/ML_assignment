README: Code Overview for Dataset Exploration, Splitting, and Linear Regression
This README provides details about the Python scripts for basic dataset exploration, data splitting, and a linear regression model implementation using the sklearn library.

1. Dataset Exploration
The goal of this section is to explore the Iris dataset, including displaying key insights.

Steps:
Load the Dataset: Using load_iris() from sklearn.datasets.
Convert to DataFrame: The data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Exploration:
Display the first five rows using head().
Retrieve the dataset's shape (number of rows and columns).
Compute summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.) using describe().
Code Snippet:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)

# Display data insights
first_five_rows = iris_df.head()
dataset_shape = iris_df.shape
summary_statistics = iris_df.describe()

print("First Five Rows of the Dataset:")
print(first_five_rows)
print("\nDataset Shape:", dataset_shape)
print("\nSummary Statistics for Each Feature:")
print(summary_statistics)
Output:
First Five Rows: Displays the first five samples.
Dataset Shape: Indicates 150 samples and 4 features.
Summary Statistics: Provides detailed statistics like mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for each feature.
2. Data Splitting
This section involves splitting the Iris dataset into training and testing sets for future model building.

Steps:
Separate features (X) and target (y) variables.
Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().
Code Snippet:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Data splitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print(f"Number of samples in the training set: {X_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Number of samples in the testing set: {X_test.shape[0]}")
Output:
Training Set: Contains 120 samples.
Testing Set: Contains 30 samples.
3. Linear Regression
This section demonstrates fitting a linear regression model on synthetic salary data.

Synthetic Dataset:
Features: YearsExperience (1â€“10 years).
Target: Salary increases linearly by $5000 per year of experience.
Steps:
Create a synthetic dataset using pandas.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Fit a linear regression model using LinearRegression from sklearn.
Predict the target variable (Salary) for the test set.
Evaluate model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE

Code Explanation
This script demonstrates three key tasks: dataset exploration, data splitting, and a basic linear regression implementation. Below is a detailed explanation of each part:

1. Dataset Exploration
This section uses the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning, to perform exploratory data analysis.

Steps:
Load the Dataset:

The load_iris() function from sklearn.datasets loads the dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers and their species.
The features are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Convert to DataFrame:

The dataset is converted into a Pandas DataFrame to make it easier to manipulate and analyze.
Exploratory Analysis:

First Five Rows: Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using .head().
Dataset Shape: The shape of the DataFrame (rows and columns) is retrieved using .shape.
Summary Statistics:
Use .describe() to compute statistics such as mean, standard deviation (std), min/max values, and percentiles for each feature.
Output:

Displays the first 5 rows, shape (150, 4), and summary statistics for each feature.
2. Data Splitting
This section splits the Iris dataset into training and testing subsets.

Steps:
Prepare Data:

X: The features (independent variables), i.e., the measurements of sepal and petal lengths/widths.
y: The target variable (dependent variable), which indicates the species.
Split Data:

The train_test_split() function splits the dataset into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio.
Training Set: Contains 80% of the data (120 samples).
Testing Set: Contains 20% of the data (30 samples).
A random_state is set for reproducibility.
Output:

Prints the number of samples in the training and testing sets.
3. Linear Regression
This section implements a simple linear regression model on synthetic salary data.

Steps:
Create Synthetic Data:

A dictionary with two columns: YearsExperience (independent variable) and Salary (dependent variable).
Data represents a linear relationship: Salary = 35000 + 5000 Ã— YearsExperience.
Split Data:

Features (X): Contains YearsExperience.
Target (y): Contains Salary.
Data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split().
Model Training:

The LinearRegression() model from sklearn.linear_model is initialized and trained using the fit() method.
Prediction and Evaluation:

The model predicts salaries for the test set using predict().
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated using mean_squared_error() to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Parameters:

Intercept: The model's starting salary when YearsExperience = 0 (calculated as 35000.00).
Coefficient: The increase in salary per year of experience (calculated as 5000.00).
Output:

Prints the MSE, intercept, and coefficient.
Summary of Results:
Dataset Exploration:
Shape: (150, 4); Summary statistics displayed for Iris features.
Data Splitting:
Training set: 120 samples.
Testing set: 30 samples.
Linear Regression:
MSE: 0.00 (model fits perfectly on the synthetic data).
Intercept: 35000.00.
Coefficient: 5000.00 (salary increases by 5000 per year of experience).
This code provides a clear understanding of key concepts in data exploration, splitting, and regression analysis.
